# R_Finance
R scripts related to finance. These scripts will be clones or adaptations of the works of the Systematic Investor and QuantStrat TradeR blogs. My focus will be dynamic Asset Allocation and dynamic Risk Parity algorithms.
This project will develop scripts in R or clone existing R scripts to build and compare the performance of various dynamic portfolios models for core asset investment.
